- Before executing the user prompt, rewrite it to be clear, structured, and actionable. Expand with a short scenario if needed, and list specific actions step-by-step. Ensure it's concise but detailed enough for correct execution, and then show it to me.
- Execute the improved prompt, without asking me to execute it or not. After applying changes, automatically run linting and fix all lint errors/warnings in the file.
