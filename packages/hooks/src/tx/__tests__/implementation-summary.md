# Fee Currency Exchange Rate Implementation Summary

## What We Accomplished

We have successfully implemented a fee currency exchange rate feature for OWallet, which allows transaction fees to be accurately calculated when different currencies are selected from the fee currency dropdown. The implementation includes:

1. **Type Definition**:
   - We utilized the existing `exchangeRate` property in the `FeeCurrency` type, which is defined as part of the `WithGasPriceStep` type in `packages/types/src/currency.ts`.

2. **Fee Calculation Logic**:
   - We updated the `getFeeTypePrettyForFeeCurrency` method in `packages/hooks/src/tx/fee.ts` to check for the presence of an `exchangeRate` property and apply it to the fee calculation.
   - The exchange rate is multiplied by the base fee amount to adjust the fee based on the relative value of the selected currency.

3. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - We created comprehensive documentation explaining how to implement and use exchange rates.
   - We provided example configurations showing how to structure fee currencies with exchange rates.
   - We created a utility script to calculate exchange rates based on current market prices.
   - We developed a JavaScript example that demonstrates how exchange rates are applied to fee calculations.

4. **Testing**:
   - We created a test file that verifies the exchange rate functionality.
   - We manually verified the implementation with a JavaScript example, which confirmed that the exchange rates are applied correctly.

## How Exchange Rates Work

The exchange rate represents the value relationship between a fee currency and the default fee currency:

- For currencies MORE valuable than the default: use `exchangeRate < 1`
  - Example: If 1 ION = 20 OSMO, then `exchangeRate = 1/20 = 0.05`
  - This results in a smaller fee amount since fewer tokens are needed.

- For currencies LESS valuable than the default: use `exchangeRate > 1`
  - Example: If 1 OSMO = 20 USDC, then `exchangeRate = 20`
  - This results in a larger fee amount since more tokens are needed.

## Example Calculation

For a transaction requiring 100,000 gas with a gas price of 0.025:

1. **Default currency (OSMO)**:
   - Fee = 100,000 × 0.025 = 2,500 uosmo

2. **More valuable currency (ION with exchangeRate = 0.05)**:
   - Fee = 100,000 × 0.025 × 0.05 = 125 uion

3. **Less valuable currency (USDC with exchangeRate = 20)**:
   - Fee = 100,000 × 0.025 × 20 = 50,000 uusdc

## Next Steps

1. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Update the config.ts file to include exchange rates for non-default fee currencies in each chain configuration.
   - Consider using the `generate-exchange-rates.ts` script to calculate accurate exchange rates based on current market prices.

2. **Testing**:
   - Conduct thorough testing with real transactions to ensure the exchange rates are applied correctly.
   - Test edge cases, such as very small or very large exchange rates.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Consider updating the UI to display the applied exchange rate when a non-default fee currency is selected.
   - Add explanatory tooltips or hints to help users understand how exchange rates affect their transaction fees.

4. **Maintenance**:
   - Develop a strategy for keeping exchange rates up-to-date as market values change.
   - Consider implementing an automatic update mechanism for exchange rates using a price oracle or API.
